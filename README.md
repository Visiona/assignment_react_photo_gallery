# Photo Gallery with React

This small application is using provided json file being excerpt from data retrieved from Instagram. App is loading all photos fro json. Here I also build in React sorting function, filtering via dropdown list and live search form where user can search for username or a specific caption in the photos.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
